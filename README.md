## Discussion of Tom Gauld Cartoon

Take a look at this cartoon by Tom Gauld for [The New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2377304-tom-gauld-science-fiction-author-or-tech-company-boss/):

To complete this assignment successfully, you will need to edit Markdown in Github. [This video demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WqGLlLhTk4z4dzxg4EyiYFr_m3SJzsg-/view) will help you do it. 

To receive credit for this discussion, edit the document "response.md." Write two original paragraphs, each containing 75-100 words. In the first paragraph, discuss what you think the cartoonist is trying to say with this cartoon. Paraphrase, describe, or quote from the cartoon in your discussion. In the second paragraph, cite a real-world article (be sure to link to it), and talk about how the article supports or refutes the cartoonists' point. 

Note that in the demo, I'll be citing the <em>Business Insider</em> article "Facebook gives its Oculus employees a dystopian sci-fi book to get them excited about building the future." You should find a different article for your submission. It can cover the same topic, but I expect to see thoughtful writing on the subject. 

To summarize, successful responses will

- Exist inside the file titled response.md
- Have two paragraphs and 150-200 words
- Describe the cartoonists' point of view, using direct references to the cartoon
- Cite at least one news article, including a link
- Explain how the news article referenced supports or refutes the cartoonists' point of view
