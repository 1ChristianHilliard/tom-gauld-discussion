  The way I see this cartoon and it is the reality we are soon going to be living in is kind of scary. Reading Ready Player One and seeing the harm (and good) it can cause is frightening for our society. It is as if fiction is no longer fiction but has become reality. I feel Mark Zuckerburg has no regard for the damage he is causing to the individuals who receive his product for the benefit of his own personal profit. 
  A cartoon shows how we, as humans, can take a book from decades ago that was science fiction and make it real with the technology we have today. I see this as beneficial in certain ways but also on the other side of the fence, I think it will do more harm than good. In a hyper-capitalistic techno-sci-fi world, we can already see the downfall of humanity. The real world is in shambles in Ready Player One, while the people abroad suffer. The real world and the digital world are starkly different. So, with that being said from the example we have been given what we are to do with this sci-fi in the now as we are trying to make this a reality I think we should keep in mind the possible outcomes this next step in technology conveys.
